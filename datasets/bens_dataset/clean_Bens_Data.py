# This method should take in a file name and return a list of lists of floats.
# Each of the lists of floats should start with something which identifies it,
# this ID is what the algorithm will return to show the clusters it has
# created. It can be an int, a String, whatever works the best for you.

# Example return data for a dataset with 2 values per datapoint:
# [[0.0, 14.6, 15.0]
#  [1.0, 4.3, 5.5]
#  [2.0, 5.6, 2.3]]
